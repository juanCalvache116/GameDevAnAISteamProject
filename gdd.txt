**Doesn't Have a Name Right Now**  
**Story Concept:**

Pirates land on a shore and kidnap an antique dealer to examine his treasures to verify whether they are cursed or not. His son goes to rescue him.  
The son infiltrates the pirate ship to save him. The ship heads to an island where the pirates believe they can break their curses.  
An incident occurs that causes the father to fall under the curse. He touches the amulet, which turns him into a box that can change and become other objects. The son now carries the amulet, which allows him to transform his father into other objects, and he must find a way to escape the pirates and break his father's curse.

**Characters:**  
Father and Son: (Decide Names)  
They live quietly near the port, working in the shop. The son is more focused on talking to the sailors and thinking about great adventures, and he has no interest in the family business. He dreams of adventures far from his father.

Pirate Captain and his crew: (Decide Names)  
Legendary pirate, angry because curses are constantly falling upon him and his crew for recklessly stealing cursed treasures.  
They want to verify the safety of their treasures and so they kidnap an antique dealer.  
They head to a cursed island where a legend says they can break its curses.
